## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

During this challenge , I learned how structure react app and how to create reusable components.
so, I created a component for the form and another for the message.
I also learned how to customize the tailwindcss configuration file to add new colors and fonts.

### Continued development

Thereafter, I will continue to learn how to use react hooks and how to use the context api to manage the state of the application. then, I will continue to learn how manage errors in the form and how to use the formik library to validate the form.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.tailwind.com/docs) - This helped me for getting started tailwind css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
